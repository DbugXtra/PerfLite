# PerfLite: A Minimalist C++ Micro-Benchmarking Library

PerfLite is a single-header C++ library designed for quick, lightweight, and customizable micro-benchmarking. It provides accurate measurement of function execution times, automatically adjusts iteration counts for stable results, and calculates essential statistical measures including mean, standard deviation, and throughput.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Single-Header:** Easy to integrate‚Äîjust include `perf_lite.h`.
* **Time Unit Flexibility:** Output results in nanoseconds (`ns`), microseconds (`¬µs`), milliseconds (`ms`), or seconds (`s`).
* **Statistical Output:** Calculates **Min Time**, **Mean Time**, **Standard Deviation (StdDev)**, and **Operations Per Second (Ops/sec)**.
* **Dynamic Iteration Adjustment:** Automatically increases the number of iterations to meet a target duration (defaulting to 100ms) for more stable, reliable measurements.
* **Optimization Barriers:** Includes a portable `DoNotOptimize` helper to prevent the compiler from eliminating benchmarked code.
* **Warmup Phase:** Executes a configurable number of warmup iterations to stabilize CPU caches and branch predictors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage and Setup

### 1. Requirements

* C++17 or later (required for `std::chrono`, `std::is_invocable_v`, etc.)
* A compatible C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)

### 2. Integration

Since `PerfLite` is a header-only library, simply copy the `perf_lite.h` file into your project and include it in your source files:

```cpp
#include "perf_lite.h"

// Your main code...
````

### 3\. Basic Example

Benchmarking a simple function call:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "perf_lite.h"

// Function to benchmark
void heavy_computation(int N) {
    long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        sum += i * i;
    }
    // Use DoNotOptimize to prevent the compiler from optimizing out the calculation
    PerfLite::DoNotOptimize(sum); 
}

int main() {
    // 1. Run with default settings (100ms target duration, ns output)
    PerfLite::BenchmarkResult result = PerfLite::benchmark(heavy_computation, 1000);
    result.print();

    // 2. Custom configuration
    PerfLite::Benchmark()
        .name("Array Sort")
        .unit(PerfLite::TimeUnit::Microseconds) // Output in ¬µs
        .warmup(50)                              // 50 warmup runs
        .target_duration(std::chrono::milliseconds(500)) // Run for 500ms
        .run([]() {
            std::vector<int> data(1000, 0);
            std::sort(data.begin(), data.end());
        })
        .print();

    return 0;
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Methods

The `PerfLite::Benchmark` class uses a fluent interface for configuration:

| Method | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.name(std::string n)` | Sets the name for the benchmark run. | `"Benchmark"` |
| `.unit(TimeUnit unit)` | Sets the time unit for the printed output. | `Nanoseconds` |
| `.warmup(size_t count)` | Sets the number of **unmeasured** warmup iterations. | `10` |
| `.iterations(size_t count)` | Sets the initial/minimum number of measured iterations. | `1000` |
| `.target_duration(std::chrono::milliseconds duration)` | Sets the total time the benchmark will attempt to run for. | `100ms` |
| `.run(Func&& func)` | Executes the benchmark. | N/A |

## üìä Understanding the Results

A robust performance measurement relies on more than just the average time.

| Field | Description | Importance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Min Time** | The **fastest** recorded single execution time. | Represents the best-case, highly optimized performance, often achieved when the CPU cache is "hot" and the OS is not interfering. |
| **Mean Time** | The arithmetic **average** of all recorded execution times. | The most common measure of typical performance. |
| **StdDev** | **Standard Deviation** (Sample). | Measures the **spread** or **volatility** of the samples. A **low** StdDev indicates stable, reliable measurements. A **high** StdDev suggests the results are polluted by system interference (OS jitter, context switching). |
| **Ops/sec** | Operations Per Second. | The **throughput** of the function, calculated as $1 / \text{Mean Time (in seconds)}$. |

**Key Takeaway:** For a benchmark to be trustworthy, the **Mean Time** and **Min Time** should be close, and the **StdDev** should be small relative to the Mean.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations for Micro-benchmarking

Due to the sensitive nature of micro-benchmarking, results can be heavily influenced by external factors. To get the most accurate, stable data:

1.  **Isolation:** Try to run benchmarks on a dedicated core or system with minimal background processes.
2.  **Stability:** Lock your CPU frequency (disable Turbo Boost) if possible to prevent dynamic frequency scaling from skewing results.
3.  **Prevent Optimization:** Always use `PerfLite::DoNotOptimize` on the return value or any side effects of the code you are measuring to ensure the compiler doesn't eliminate the code entirely.
